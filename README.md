# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz README

## This is a readme file for my fourth homework assignment, the JS code quiz.

I wanted to explore what we've learned in Web APIs and DOM manipulation.

1. I rewatched the videos from class.
2. I reached out to my tutor for help.
3. I'm still working on my code--unfortunately, I did quite a bit of work, but I can't figure out why my start button is no longer working.
4. I plan on continuing to work on this code, potentially starting from the beginning, as I feel quite lost. (1/19/2021)

My takeaways are that I still need practice in DOM manipulation.
